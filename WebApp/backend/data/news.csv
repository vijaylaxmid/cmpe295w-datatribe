16a35867-df19-3ec3-afee-8689a3bea87d;AAPL;Benzinga's Bulls And Bears Of The Week: Apple, Boeing, Intel, Netflix, Tesla And More;"Benzinga has examined the prospects for many investor favorite stocks over the past week. The past week's bullish calls included the iPhone maker, clean energy stocks and an aerospace giant. Video streaming and electric vehicle leaders were among the bearish calls seen during the week. The big three U.S. indexes ended this past week fractionally lower. Earning season was off to a largely solid start, despite rising COVID-19 fears, increasing volatility and growing concern about higher taxes. However, there were some prominent disappointments among the quarterly results and outlooks. Even some companies with solid results were punished. Also last week, the price of crude hit a one-month high before retreating, and interest rates headed lower, with pent-up reopening demand still clear ahead of the summer travel season. Things were choppy for cryptocurrency, and Wall Street may already be turning its attention to the coming quarters and even 2022. The iPhone maker revealed new products at last week's event, even as a key supplier suffered a ransomware attack and big tech giants faced the U.S. Senate in an antitrust hearing. Furthermore, it increasingly looks like the global chip shortage will drag on for quite a while. The U.S. Supreme Court has limited the power of a top regulator. And the Olympics may be under threat. Through it all, Benzinga continued to examine the prospects for many of the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week's most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look. Bulls The hits from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) just keep coming.

c015be59-4dd5-3c96-9f2e-ddbcce4f7474;AAPL;Apple to Launch Program for Employees to Get Covid-19 Shots;(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is launching a program to help employees get vaccinated against Covid-19, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The company is working with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. to give workers the shots at Apple offices. The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is rolling out a website for staff to sign up for appointments. The company previously told staff that, as a private company, it didn’t have access to Covid-19 vaccines for staff members. However, vaccine availability in California has expanded considerably and all residents in the state are now eligible to receive shots.Apple previously encouraged employees to get vaccines, offering sick leave for days missed when taking the shot and to recover from symptoms. This new voluntary program may encourage more staff members to return to Apple’s offices in the coming months. Still, the company has not yet asked employees to return, nor is an imminent return required for signing up for a shot through the program, the people said. They asked not to be identified discussing private matters. An Apple spokeswoman confirmed the initiative. Read more: If They Nail Vaccinations, Drugstores Will Be the Heroes of 2021Apple isn’t the first major corporation to help employees get shots. Amazon.com Inc. has been vaccinating frontline workers. Other technology giants like Facebook Inc. and Google have been supporting vaccine distribution for the general public, especially in underserved communities. Apple recently added a button in its Maps app to help users find vaccination centers. Unlike some rivals, Apple hasn’t publicly said when employees will be expected to return to offices, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has told staff he anticipates a larger number of employees will start returning in June.“There’s no replacement for face-to-face collaboration, but we have also learned a great deal about how we can get our work done outside of the office without sacrificing productivity or results,” he told staff last year. Apple has had some mission-critical staff working in the office since the beginning of the pandemic. Some engineers have also been back for months working for a limited number of hours per week.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.;Fri, 23 Apr 2021 17:50:33 +0000;AAPL_2021-04-23;0.9725;0.0

4f9528e7-34cf-3b6a-adec-67909eb9d30c;MSFT;Is Apex Technology Merging With AvePoint Too Soon?;AvePoint Inc. reported preliminary first quarter 2021 results on April 14. The largest data management solutions provider for Microsoft 365 is set to merge with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Apex Technology Acquisition (NASDAQ:APXT). Once the merger is complete, APXT stock will change to AVPT, but remain on the same exchange. Source: Dmitry Demidovich/ShutterStock.com Ironically, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates told CNBC listeners in early April that companies have flipped from waiting too long to go public to not waiting long enough. Is AvePoint such a company? A look at its latest preliminary results suggests it’s not going public too early. Here’s why. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips AvePoint’s Been Around AvePoint’s Executive Chairman Kai Gong and CEO TJ Jiang co-founded the company in 2001. The duo developed DocAve for Microsoft SharePoint. They coded the program in a New Jersey library, making little to no money for the first three years. Over the next 20 years, AvePoint developed more than 40 solutions for Microsoft Office 365 and SharePoint platforms. If you’re interested in the company, you ought to read this 2018 interview with Dr. Jiang. It will tell you all you need to know about what the company does to make a buck. Interestingly, Jiang was a software developer for big banks before co-founding AvePoint. His office was on the 40th floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center. His survival taught him that life was too short, and that we need to follow our passions. In Jiang’s case, it was doing something entrepreneurial, such as founding a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business. Twenty years later, he’s still at it. 7 Retail Stocks With E-commerce Locked In It’s a great story. It demonstrates that AvePoint’s leader has been around the block and back, and understands how the tech sector works. So, the fact I’m questioning its quest to go public probably will be seen by some as a slight against the company. But I don’t happen to see it that way. What Do the Numbers Say About APXT Stock? The company’s April 14 press release says that AvePoint’s total annual recurring revenue (ARR) will be between $128 million and $129.2 million for the 12 months ended March 31. Its ARR in Q1 2021 grew 32.6% year-over-year at the midpoint. Considering it had little to no revenue until 2004, building to $128 million in ARR seems to be a reasonable accomplishment for the two founders. By going to market at this point, patient investors such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), who first invested in the company in 2014, will be able to exit their investments after seven years, which is about the average holding period for venture capital (VC) investors. Clearly, everyone involved with AvePoint saw the SPAC phenomenon as an opportunity that might not come along again for a very long time. According to InvestorPlace’s Matt McCall, at $11 a share, AvePoint has a market value of $2.19 billion and an enterprise value of $1.94 billion. Based on projected 2021 and 2022 revenue of $193 million and $257 million, respectively, AvePoint is being valued at 7.5x 2022 sales. As my colleague points out, that’s hardly expensive relative to other SaaS players that trade at much higher multiples. For example, Coupa Software (NASDAQ:COUP) had an operating loss of $166.6 million in fiscal 2021 on $541.6 million in sales. It’s currently valued at 22 times next year’s revenue estimate of $847 million. APXT Stock: The Bottom Line Honestly, when I started this article — I’ve never written about APXT stock before — I was hell-bent on proving that Apex Technology was just another SPAC taking a target public too quickly. It’s especially ironic, given AvePoint is tied at the hip to Microsoft, Bill Gates’ legacy. However, the more I look at its business, the history of its founders, and their struggles, I’m not sure what else they would learn by remaining a private company. With revenues growing at a 30%+ pace and profits mere quarters away, I think the timing’s actually quite good. AvePoint is one tech stock I’ll be keeping an eye on once the merger is official. It’s got an excellent future. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

30c91701-919b-39ae-9c62-c3ffc3488916;MSFT;4 AI Stocks Leading the Pack;It’s difficult to overstate the importance of artificial intelligence in the current world. Accenture (NYSE:ACN) survey indicates that “3 out of 4 C-suite executives believe that if they don’t scale artificial intelligence in the next five years, they risk going out of business entirely.” Given the potential market size and application across industries, AI stocks have grabbed the attention of investors. The good news is that the artificial intelligence market is still at an early growth stage. Companies that are current leaders in the AI space have ample headroom for expansion. A Kearney article, “Embrace AI to Survive” opines that “AI has reached only a small fraction of its full potential. The race is on, and some contenders have moved ahead, but nobody has a commanding lead.” Clearly, the market today is just the tip of the iceberg. This presents a big opportunity for AI stocks. It is forecasted that for fiscal year 2021, the AI market is estimated at $327.5 billion. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.5% through FY2024. I will not be surprised if healthy growth sustains beyond this forecast period.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Retail Stocks With E-commerce Locked In Let’s discuss four AI stocks that are positioned to be among the industry leaders in the coming years. These stocks are worth considering for the long-term portfolio. C3.ai (NYSE:AI) ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI Stocks Leading the Pack: C3.ai (AI) Source: shutterstock AI stock has plunged after making highs of $183.90 towards the end of fiscal year 2020. Currently, the stock trades at $69.76, and the deep correction seems like a good buying opportunity. While earnings might have disappointed the markets, there is long-term value in the stock. For the third quarter of 2021, the company reported revenue of $49.1 million, which was higher by 19% on a year-on-year basis. Importantly, subscription revenue was $42.7 million and was higher by 23%. On the flipside, the company continued to report operating level loss. For the year, C3.ai expects operating losses at approximately $50 million. The key point to note is that as recurring subscription revenue increases, cash flows upside is likely. Therefore, I don’t see operating losses as a big concern. It’s worth noting that the company has expanded its market presence in the climate and energy sustainability market. Partners include Microsoft, Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR). This segment is likely to accelerate growth in the long-term. In addition, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army and New York Power Authority are among the company’s clients. It seems that C3.ai has a strong base for delivering higher growth in the coming years. The AI stock correction is therefore an opportunity to accumulate. ServiceNow (NOW) Source: Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock.com NOW stock is another interesting name among AI stocks. The stock has surged by 90% in the last year and looks good for further upside. ServiceNow operates several platforms that includes machine learning, intelligent chatbot, AI-powered search and performance analytics. Recently, the company acquired Intellibot, which is a robotic process automation company. The company already has a robust client base with 6,900 global enterprise customers. From a cash flow visibility perspective, the company has over 95% renewal rate. Furthermore, as of FY2020, subscription service revenue was 95% of the total revenue. For FY2020, ServiceNow reported subscription revenue of $4.3 billion, which was higher by 32% on a y-o-y basis. For the current year, subscription revenue is guided at $5.5 billion. Importantly, the company’s free cash flow was $1.4 billion last year. It seems very likely that FCF will be over $2.0 billion (annualized) over the next 24 months. 7 Great Retirement Stocks for Gen Z Therefore, the company has financial headroom to pursue aggressive organic and inorganic growth. In February 2021, Argus Research raised the price target for NOW stock in the range of $600 to $640. NOW stock is positioned to continue trending higher. Microsoft (MSFT) Source: Peteri / Shutterstock.com Among the bigger technology names, MSFT stock is worth adding in the portfolio of AI stocks. The stock has been in a steady uptrend and valuation still looks attractive at a forward price-to-earnings-ratio of 31.95. Recently, Microsoft announced a deal to acquire Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) at a price of $56 per share. The latter is a cloud and AI software company with a focus on the healthcare sector. The company has strong presence in the U.S. with 77% of U.S. hospitals being Nuance customers. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft believes that “AI is technology’s most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application.” With the acquisition, the company will be positioned to accelerate its presence in the healthcare sector. The above statement also indicates the fact that Microsoft is focused on AI for growth in the coming years. It’s worth noting that Microsoft has also invested in C3.ai with a total exposure of 1.19 million shares. In October 2020, C3.ai, Microsoft and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) entered into a partnership to re-invest CRM with artificial intelligence. I will not be surprised if C3.ai is another potential acquisition target for the Microsoft as it accelerates investments in AI. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com NVDA stock is another big name to consider among AI stocks. As a leading provider of artificial intelligence chips, the company is positioned for strong growth. In the last year, the biggest development for the company in the AI segment has been the acquisition of Arm Limited for consideration of $40 billion. With the acquisition, “Nvida will now be placed at the forefront of Arm’s IoT ecosystem and cloud-based AI edge computing.” Autonomous driving is one segment where Nvidia seems to have made significant inroads. The company will be partnering with TuSimple (NASDAQ:TSP) for autonomous trucks that are likely to commence production in FY2024. Nvidia has also been active in the healthcare segment. In April 2021, the company partnered with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) on a “new AI research projects using breakthrough transformer neural networks.” As Nvidia spreads its wings across different sectors with AI application, NVDA stock is worth holding in the portfolio. Recently, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso upgraded NVDA stock with a price target of $750. This would imply an upside of 23% from current levels around $608.

5402465f-817d-3162-8803-aeb8115a9e91;MSFT;President Biden's Tax Proposal Targets Big Tech's $100B Overseas Profit: Bloomberg;President Joe Biden’s tax boost proposals under his infrastructure bill have targeted technology giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB), Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), who had reported over $100 billion in non-U.S. profits in their last fiscal years, Bloomberg reports. The tech industry prefers to stash profits at low-tax offshore jurisdictions due to easier mobility of their main assets like software code, patents, and other intellectual property compared to factories and other physical assets. The addition of extra deductions and other benefits to Donald Trump’s 2017 tax plan diluted its attempt to recover taxes from overseas profits. However, Biden’s law will further intensify the country’s friction with the tech companies over misinformation and antitrust investigations. Amazon Chair, Jeff Bezos, has endorsed higher corporate taxes. Intel’s Pat Gelsinger panned Biden’s plan. Trump’s 2017 global intangible low-taxed income (Gilti) targeted non-U.S. profits from intangible assets. Biden plans to double the Gilti tax rate to 21% from 10.5% and restrict foreign tax credits. It could increase corporate tax bills by almost $300 billion over a decade, with most of the burden falling on the tech sector. Microsoft’s annual Gilti tax bill could more than double to $2 billion. Microsoft generated 86% of its foreign pretax income from Ireland and Puerto Rico operations in 2020, which have lower corporate tax rates than the U.S. The 2017 tax law also allowed a tax deduction for overseas intangible income (FDII) to encourage the companies to retain their intangible assets at home country. Google’s share of domestic income rose after it began licensing intellectual property in the U.S. in 2019. Facebook followed suit. However, Biden FDII’s annulment proposal would raise the tax bills of tech companies. Amazon claimed $500 million in total FDII deductions in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Biden also proposed a 15% minimum book tax on high-profit organizations that escape taxes via research and development, foreign credits, and stock-based compensation. Google, Amazon, and Apple’s tax bills would be higher by $847 million, $1.2 billion, and $3.8 billion, respectively, if Biden’s book tax existed in 2020. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) also represents several countries outside the U.S. over similar tax concerns. The OECD sought to replace the digital services taxes to procure higher revenue from companies like Google and Facebook. However, Amazon is escaping on the pretext of its thin margins.

2cc9badb-c95e-3993-a9d3-0b6b16894962;NFLX;Could Netflix Help Shares Of Formula One?;One of the most popular sports in the world is Formula One, but the racing league does not attract the same viewership numbers in the U.S. as it does in other markets. That could be changing thanks to a docuseries on Netflix. Netflix Series: Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) launched a documentaries series called “Formula One: Drive to Survive” in 2019 highlighting the popular world racing sports league, owned by Liberty Formula One Group (NASDAQ: FWONA)(NASDAQ: FWONK). “Netflix’s ‘Formula One: Drive to Survive’ has used a unique combination of behind-the-scenes access and passionate storytelling to increase fan engagement,” Huddle Up Founder Joe Pompliano told Benzinga. Formula One stock is the largest current holding in the newly launched Roundhill MVP ETF (NYSE: MVP) representing 9.5% of assets. “Just like a successful F1 team, Netflix has nailed the release timing of their 'Drive to Survive' docuseries,” Roundhill’s Vice President Sean Poyntz told Benzinga. Poyntz said the release right before the start of the next season will serve as an “appetizer” for viewers. Increased Engagement: Netflix has over 200 million global subscribers. The company’s large base of U.S. subscribers may have had their first experience with Formula One through the docuseries. “To the unconverted F1 fan, the series helps to tell each team’s story, making it more than just cars going around a track,” Poyntz said. Poyntz said the increased engagement could lead to more appeal to sponsors from some of the smaller teams. “Engagement across social media platforms is up 99% year-over-year. The season opener in Bahrain was the most-viewed U.S. race ever, and perhaps most importantly, over 75% of F1’s audience growth in 2020 came from the coveted 16-35 age demographic,” Pompliano said. Viewership for the Bahrain Grand Prix first race of 2021 saw record viewership in the U.S. on ESPN2, owned by the Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS). Over 879,000 fans tuned in, marking the best audience for a Formula One race in the U.S. since 2019 and the highest on ESPN2 ever. Viewership of the Bahrain Grand Prix also broke viewership records in the U.K., where it is aired on Sky Sports, owned by Comcast Corp (NASDAQ: CMCSA), with 2.23 million viewers. Related Link: Exclusive: Roundhill MVP, First Pure Play Sports ETF Offers Growth, SPACs, Exposure To NFTs What’s Next: The partnership between Netflix and Formula One has increased brand awareness and viewership which could lead to additional revenue opportunities. Streaming and television rights could be increased, according to Pompliano. Pompliano, who is also a partner on the MVP ETF, said Oracle Corp (NYSE: ORCL) credited the “massive increase in excitement around Formula 1 in the United States” as a contributing factor when signing a sponsorship with the Red Bull team in 2021. Formula One recently announced a 10-year deal to add Miami as its second U.S. city on the circuit beginning in 2022. Austin, Texas, is currently the only U.S. city to have a race on the annual circuit. The deal makes Miami the 11th U.S. location to have a Formula One race since 1950. “With both Fort Lauderdale and Miami International airports servicing the area, the Miami Grand Prix should be the ideal opportunity for fans to experience a race weekend in person, hopefully converting them into diehard fans,” Poyntz said. There are not any U.S. drivers in Formula One currently. The increased engagement and viewership in the U.S. could possibly be boosted even more with drivers from the U.S. Financials: The pandemic impacted the revenue for Liberty Formula One Group with 17 events last year instead of the 21 in the previous year. Only three of the events featured fans in attendance, and those events had limited capacity. The company reported full-year revenue of $1.15 billion compared to $2.02 billion in the prior year. Fourth quarter revenue of $485 million came in under the prior year’s $523 million. The fourth quarter was helped by the timing of seven races being featured versus five the prior year due to the season being compacted in the second half of the year. The company plans to have a record 23 events in 2021, which could help with a rebound in revenue. Price Action: Shares of FWONK closed at $47.24 on Friday. Shares have traded between $25.23 and $48.49 over the last 52 weeks.

5f7abc05-7bf9-332a-b74c-53c341bc6dd5;NFLX;What Rotation? Some Winning Covid Stocks Thrive Amid Reopening;(Bloomberg) -- The death of the stay-at-home trade has been greatly exaggerated.Vaccines and declining Covid-19 infection rates in the U.S. were supposed to spell doom for last year’s best performing stocks amid a rotation into companies poised to benefit from the return to life as usual. While that’s played out for much of the group, the opposite is happening in some corners of the market.Shares of furniture makers, home-improvement retailers and outdoor recreation companies continue to soar to new heights with few signs that the surge in demand that propelled sales over the past year is abating. RH, the purveyor of $4,000 couches, has jumped 54% this year. RV retailer Camping World Holdings Inc. is up 65%.The reasons why were on full display this week as first-quarter financial results poured in. Swimming pool supplies company Pool Corp. and rural lifestyle retailer Tractor Supply Co. were among companies that smashed Wall Street estimates. Both cited growing demand fueled by behavioral changes related to the virus as well as government stimulus, prompting higher forecasts for the rest of the year.“Our customer base is experiencing robust, broad-based shopping patterns that provide significant opportunities for growth,” Hal Lawton, chief executive officer of Tractor Supply, said on the company’s earnings call. “These types of trends can simply be described as once-in-a-generation.”Millions of vaccine doses delivered in the U.S. were supposed to unleash a wave of pent-up demand at places like movie theaters and gyms that were hard -- if not impossible -- to access last year. While that’s been true in many cases, habits formed during the peak of the crisis are proving to be longer lasting than many had anticipated.The other big factor is a red-hot housing market helped by low mortgage rates and a relocation from cities to suburbs. That continues to drive demand for everything from home furnishings to materials needed for construction and remodeling.The trends behind most of these stock rallies are likely to continue well into 2022, according to Cristina Fernandez, an analyst with Telsey Advisory Group. She expects strong results from Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos Inc. in coming quarters thanks to pent-up demand from do-it-yourself customers and professional services.Spending HabitsOf course, many of last year’s biggest winners have lost billions in market value this year as investors brace for slower growth. Netflix Inc. showed this week that huge subscriber gains clocked in 2020 are proving difficult to maintain. The stock sank 7% on Wednesday after reporting about 4 million new subscribers in the first quarter, the weakest start to a year since 2013. The stock is now trading around the level it was in July.Netflix’s results were seen as a potential harbinger of similar results for others like Peloton Interactive Inc., whose 13% decline this week was its worst since February. After gaining more than five-fold in 2020, the maker of stationary bikes and treadmills has tumbled 33% this year. Amazon.com Inc. results on Thursday will be closely watched for signs of slowing growth in e-commerce and web services sales.With Americans’ savings still flush from missed spending opportunities and stimulus, the near-term leadership of the stock market may very well be determined by where they choose to spend it. Goldman Sachs strategists including Arjun Menon and David Kostin raised their recommendation on consumer-discretionary stocks to “overweight” in a note on Thursday as excess savings meet the continued reopening of the economy. They expect the group will experience the largest positive earnings revisions of any sector.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.;Sat, 24 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000;NFLX_2021-04-24;0.989;0.5267

d8981b8d-daf6-3e74-91a9-3012f7ee9bef;NFLX;Billionaire Mark Cuban Is Betting Big On NFTs, Extends Buy And Hold Strategy;- Many billionaires tracked by both Forbes and Portfolio Insider are famously out of touch with modern blockchain infrastructure. But not Mark Cuban, the billionaire is all in on blockchain after infamously selling his startup Broadcast.com to Yahoo in the first internet boom for $5.7 billion in stock. After all, Mr. Cuban tells savvy investors that if he were to do it all over again, he would center his business around blockchain technology, smart contracts and NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. And he is putting his money where his mouth is. The host of the TV show ‘Shark Tank' recently doubled down on his investments in NFT’s by initiating multiple stakes in non-fungible token companies. The billionaire jumped in the NFT space with both feet since the beginning of this year. He bought stakes in NFT platforms like SuperRare, Mintable, Cryptoslam & OpenSea. The NFT market, which stood around $250 million last year, is on pace for record growth. Blockchain startups like Alchemy have grown 54-fold since August to power $25 billion worth of Ethereum projects, according to Bloomberg and Portfolio Insider. Along with investments in NFTs, the billionaire investor has also been snapping up crypto coins: “Bitcoin is not going to be a currency. It’s not going to be a hedge against fiat and printing too many fiat dollars. It is a store of value that is going to increase in value because it’s scarce.” Cuban uses a Coinbase wallet for bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital coins portfolio. Good enough, he bought shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase on the day of its public debut on Nasdaq. Along with crypto-assets, NFTs, and non-fungible tokens, he loves to invest in traditional high-growth stocks. Here are some of Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban’s top high-growth stocks: Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) Amazon.com, the world’s largest e-commerce giant, has been ace in the hole for Mark Cuban. Last year, he revealed that he started buying Amazon in the range of $500 to $700, and his “buy and hold” strategy is paying off big time. “I have close to a billion dollars in Amazon stock,” Cuban said last year. “It’s my biggest holding.” Amazon's stock price rallied 44% in the last twelve months and its shares are up 432% in the past five years -- thanks to a consistent high double-digit revenue and earnings growth. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) The world’s largest streaming giant is the second-largest stock holding of the Shark Tank investor. Believe it or not, he holds a stake in Netflix ever since it was trading around $50 a share. With the shares now at around $500, the stock has been a jackpot with a 1,200% paper gain on Mr. Cuban’s early investment. Mark Cuban revealed in an interview that he holds more than 50,000 shares of Netflix, and he remains bullish on the streaming stock despite the flood of competitors entering the streaming market. “Every single new smart TV that has come out has Netflix as an option. When you go to the gym, every smart workout device has Netflix as an option,” Cuban said. “It’s ubiquitous not just here, but it’s becoming more ubiquitous globally as well ... I don’t see the competition negatively impacting that at all.” With more than 208 million in paid memberships, Netflix raked in a record $7.1 billion in revenue during the March quarter. He believes Netflix will be able to shake off its disappointing first-quarter subscriber growth figures and projections for the current quarter. He also believes that further post-earnings stock decline could create an opportunity for shareholders like himself. Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) Mark Cuban is a long-time shareholder in Twitter. And he swooped in to boost his stake last year when Twitter's stock price plummeted to its 52-week low on worries over advertising revenue. Buying on the dip worked like a charm for Mr. Cuban. The stock price of the social media company rallied 161% in the last twelve months, extending the five-year gains to 284%. The surge in global internet advertising is among the key catalysts behind Twitter’s stock price rally. Economic reopening and improving fundamentals for the global traveling and tourism industry will fuel growth into advertising revenues in 2021.

This is not a reason to shy away from it, quite the opposite. Today, the goal is to re-evaluate an entry from these levels. Source: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock.com The reason for the fall was nothing specific to the company. In fact, it’s doing better than DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) who came to market with it. DASH is down twice as much. It is also a little extra concerning that markets are near all-time highs and these two are floundering.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Airbnb is part of the leisure and hospitality sector. They suffered a huge blow from the pandemic, and their survival is testament to good management skills. It wasn’t pretty, but they are hanging in there. The inoculation process is going well in the U.S. and other countries are also ramping up efforts. Soon most people will feel more comfortable about moving about. 7 Retail Stocks With E-Commerce Locked In Many families completely canceled all trips. In mine, we still vacationed in Cancun last July but we were the exception, not the rule. Judging the stock negatively now is a mistake. ABNB stock is facing unusual and unique circumstances not likely to repeat. Long term, these will abate. ABNB Stock Is Where It Should Be Source: Charts by TradingView Two months ago, when the stock was at its highest, I wrote about going long Airbnb. But since it was trading at its all-time high, I suggested to buy it on a dip. In fact, I specifically pointed out $175 per share as an interesting spot for that. Here it is 70 days later toying with these levels. At these levels, it makes more sense than a runaway stock during a pandemic. Those who are surprised it fell need to learn how to avoid the FOMO in the future. I don’t usually aim to be perfect picking my entries. Therefore, I accept the possibility of lower prices in the near future. However, I am confident that there are support levels at $160 and through $150 per share. Starting a bullish position this close to those supports makes sense. I have even more history with this particular ABNB stock level. Late in December I wrote about its upside potential. At the time the stock was coming up into the same zone it is at now. This makes it the definition of a pivot point. Because back then it was the trigger that delivered the highs. Now it is likely to act as the base for a rebound and beyond. There Is Extrinsic Risk I would like to throw a small flag on the play, and it comes from my fear of the overall market. We are going into a seasonably vulnerable stretch. The “sell in May and go away” often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. I expect some drama in the next few weeks. Moreover, next week we will hear from the giga-caps reporting earnings. This group can move the whole market with it. The reaction to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is not comforting to what the rest can face. The overnight reaction to the earnings is arbitrary. I am confident that they will deliver strong earnings. What we can’t forecast is how the investors will react. NFLX improved earnings by 139% over last year and grew sales by 24%. The markets were expecting something they didn’t get so they panicked. This extrinsic risk weakens the conviction in ABNB stock temporarily. Value Is Not an Ally to the Airbnb Bulls Fundamentally, the company is growing revenue. But the metrics of late are a mess and the losses are piling up. The confusion from the pandemic makes it impossible to really gauge its value. This falling knife has no arguments from value to help support it. The bulls cannot be too brave with catching it. Therefore, my primary bullish assumption today is that of a technical nature. All year, the buyers have defended several support levels that lie below current price. I can assume they continue to do that for as long as the markets do not crash. If we indeed have a market correction, I expect that the bears will try to push the ABNB stock lower. It came out of the IPO gate weak and fell 25% in four days. The next two weeks were very violent but it kept setting higher-lows. In the process, they established the consolidation zone below $160 per share. I suspect that on the way down, it will serve as a band of support. Catching falling knives is dangerous even in the the strongest companies. Doing so in one this new and speculative raises the level of risk folds over. This is to say that investors should be realistic with their level of certainty. I find it good practice to take small bites rather than a full meal at once. Keeping the size of the potential mistakes small makes for happier trading in the long run. Patience is indeed a skill necessary skill for success. The fear of missing out and the fear of panic cause us to commit mistakes. If we are patient on the upper and lower extremes, we can avoid as many of these situations as possible.

4e6db459-001d-3d7a-aabf-95d2564dd161;NFLX;Biggest QQQ Exodus Since 2000 Ups the Ante on Big Tech Earnings;(Bloomberg) -- Tech’s uninspired start to earnings season has investors dumping billions before the sector’s heavyweights report next week.The $161 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 exchange-traded fund (ticker QQQ) has bled nearly $6 billion over the past five days in its worst stretch since the dot-com era of 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tech has suffered this week after stay-at-home stalwart Netflix Inc. reported disappointing subscriber growth in the first quarter, helping drag QQQ to its first weekly drop in over a month.After Netflix’s disastrous opening volley, the pressure is on the rest of the Faang block of megacap tech stocks to deliver, including Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which are scheduled to release earnings next week. While the few tech companies that have already reported have surprised on earnings by 18% on average, their stock prices have barely moved in the following 24 hours, data compiled by Bloomberg show.“With earning season starting to heat up, especially for the tech sector next week, it is likely that the expectations for technology companies may be too high,” said James Pillow, managing director at Moors & Cabot Inc. “It’s early still, but just look where the earnings surprises are coming from: materials, energy, and financials, all about 80% or higher. Money will follow performance -- and the performance is coming from those sectors.”ETF flows reflect the shift. Financials-tracking ETFs have attracted $15.7 billion in inflows so far in 2021, while energy and materials funds have absorbed $14.4 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, tech ETFs have posted inflows of just $3.9 billion year-to-date, after QQQ alone took in $16.7 billion in 2020 -- the most since 2000.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.;Fri, 23 Apr 2021 15:19:09 +0000;NFLX_2021-04-23;0.9455;0.0
ca1d5d21-aa49-3399-bb18-b8b2850328a3;NFLX;Top Stocks 2021: If You Only Buy One AI Stock, It Better Be C3.ai;Editor’s Note: This article is a part of our “If You Only Buy One Stock” series where we look at 2021’s most popular investing trends and have our top financial journalists make their very best pick. Click here to see more names for your must-buy list. Artificial intelligence is the future. I’m not saying this in the Minority Report kind of way. Rather, I believe those investing in AI stocks today do have a real shot at outperforming the market long-term. Source: Shutterstock Computers are smarter than us. Plain and simple. Yes, humans are required to power the algorithms behind these AI super-platforms. However, the reality is we’re moving toward an automated world. There’s some pretty interesting trends right now underway, and I’d encourage investors to go with the flow on this one.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Now, aside from robots stealing everyone’s jobs and Big Brother watching our every move, AI technology is re-shaping how we live, work and are entertained. Anyone who has seen an eerily-accurate advertisement on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) or noticed how impressive the recommendations are on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) knows what I mean. 7 Retail Stocks With E-commerce Locked In Now, it’s critical to note that Google and Netflix have developed their business models based on machine learning and AI in-house. They’re among the largest technology firms out there, with incredible manpower and resources to do so. Smaller companies (and they don’t necessarily have to be that small) may not have this luxury. The investment in developing a custom AI solution can be massive. And many companies simply don’t want to flip the bill for doing everything from scratch. Enter: C3.ai (NYSE:AI). C3.ai has found a very intriguing niche in providing AI models at scale for such companies. These are intended to be used as powerful prediction tools, driving incredible productivity growth for their clients. Here’s more on why I’m bullish on C3.ai as the AI stock of the future. C3.ai Is the “Every Man’s” AI Stock Bringing the AI revolution to the masses is a tall task. However, C3.ai seems to be up to the challenge. The company’s products help enterprise businesses get the AI solutions they need without the capital investment. In return, C3.ai picks up a nice revenue stream with some pretty stable (and growing) cash flows for investors. By targeting a very wide audience, C3.ai’s value proposition is certainly interesting for long-term investors. Better yet, this stock has been on a steady decline of late. Investors are able to pick up AI stock at roughly a 60% discount from its peak. However, this stock has been discounted for a reason. Investors appear to be concerned with the company’s relatively high valuation multiple. Today, AI stock is trading near 40-times sales, a level reserved for only the highest-growth stocks in the market. Accordingly, while AI stock has grown its sales (primarily organically) at a 19% year-over-year clip, that may not be fast enough for investors right now. There’s certainly potential for AI stock to accelerate its growth over time. And in such a scenario, I could see this stock taking off. However, the recent price action with AI stock suggests investors may be waiting on the sidelines for now to see how this company performs in the coming quarters. Conclusion The artificial intelligence space is one I personally find intriguing. Indeed, there’s a ton of long-term growth potential underpinning companies like C3.ai right now. Unfortunately for value investors, a lot of this growth is priced in at the moment. Additionally, given where valuations are today, I understand the skepticism of jumping into such perfectly-priced names. However, for those looking for a company with the potential to dominate its sector, AI stock is certainly worth a look. I’m on the sidelines with this stock, mainly due to its valuation right now. However, the growth thesis with C3.ai is one that could result in the company growing its way into its current valuation. It’s certainly possible.

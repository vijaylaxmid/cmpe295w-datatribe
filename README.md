# Deep learning based automated trading application

## Overview
=====

We have designed an application which can be used to predict future stock prices. Live trading as well as paper trading have been implemented. Our application imitates the intersection of deep learning and finance. It demonstrates how deep learning can help predict market trends, take wise investment decisions, and turn oneâ€™s portfolio profitable.The project automates the entire process for trading securities on popular exchanges and reduces the burden of studying and timing the market for the retail investors.The application also provides an easy-to-use interface to visualize the market trends, manage portfolio, perform trade operations, and receive notifications.
